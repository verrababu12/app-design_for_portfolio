      <h1>App Design</h1>
      <p>
        I design apps that prioritize user experience and visual appeal,
        focusing on clean interfaces and intuitive navigation. My goal is to
        create apps that users love to interact with, delivering both style and
        functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>My Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        Each app design project follows a structured process to ensure that it
        meets both business objectives and user needs:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Concept Development:</strong> Understanding the app's purpose,
          target users, and business goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wireframing & Prototyping:</strong> Creating app layouts and
          interactive prototypes to map out the user journey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Visual Design:</strong> Crafting a visually engaging interface
          using modern design principles and branding elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterative Testing:</strong> Testing the app's usability with
          real users and refining the design based on feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Launch & Support:</strong> Providing design support during the
          app's launch and post-launch updates.
        </li>
      </ol>
